## Repository Description
This repository contains all practical work completed during the semester, including laboratory exercises and programming tasks related to computer graphics and multimedia systems. The repository demonstrates the application of graphical concepts through coding and experimentation.

The programs focus on building a clear understanding of visual rendering, transformations, and multimedia components using structured programming approaches.

All work has been written, compiled, and tested independently on my personal computer.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- C / C++
- OpenGL and supporting libraries
- Visual Studio Code
- GCC / MinGW or equivalent compiler

## Program Execution Guidelines
1. Open the project files in Visual Studio Code  
2. Compile the source code using a compatible compiler  
3. Run the program from the terminal or command prompt  
4. Observe the graphical or console output  

## Execution Proof
For verification purposes, output screenshots are provided separately. These screenshots include:
- The source code editor
- Successful compilation and execution
- Program output window

This confirms that the programs were executed successfully on a local machine.

## Academic Honesty
All programs and documentation in this repository are my own work. External references were consulted only to understand concepts and were not copied directly.
